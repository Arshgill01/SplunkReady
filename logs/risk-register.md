# Risk Register

## Active Risks

### R001 LLM-Judging-LLM Drift

Risk: grader becomes vague AI scoring.

Mitigation: deterministic checks decide pass/fail; LLMs explain and patch.

### R002 Fake Specimen Agent

Risk: demo agent is scripted to fail/pass.

Mitigation: build a real naive agent and preserve trace.

### R003 Fixture/Live Divergence

Risk: fixture demo does not represent live MCP path.

Mitigation: shared adapter interface and shared schemas.

### R004 Generic Dashboard Drift

Risk: UI becomes cards and scores without provenance.

Mitigation: receipt and trace evidence are primary.

### R005 Splunk Feature Collision

Risk: product looks like MCP telemetry, ES triage, or detection testing.

Mitigation: keep pre-production agent certification as boundary.

## Wave 41 Closure Assessment

Status: no blocker risk remains for the current final-QA gate.

- R001 LLM-Judging-LLM Drift: controlled. Deterministic grader tests pass, and LLMs are not used as the primary pass/fail judge.
- R002 Fake Specimen Agent: controlled. The specimen agent and trace fixtures are executable, and the demo shows before/after behavior through receipts and traces.
- R003 Fixture/Live Divergence: controlled with continued monitoring. Fixture and live paths share the adapter boundary; Wave 44 remains planned for optional live operator hardening.
- R004 Generic Dashboard Drift: controlled with continued monitoring. UI claims are backed by receipt, trace, and violation data; Wave 43 remains planned for Antigravity/Gemini UI sidecar polish.
- R005 Splunk Feature Collision: controlled. README and submission copy keep SplunkReady positioned as pre-production agent certification, not a chatbot, SOC copilot, MCP telemetry, or detection-health product.

Residual risks are not blockers for Wave 41, but they remain active monitoring items for Wave 42+ continuation work.
