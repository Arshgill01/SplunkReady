## 2026-06-01 11:33 - Wave 01

Scope:
- Locked the implementation-facing product narrative.
- Added a root README entry point.
- Resolved reviewer Wave 00 control-system findings that arrived after the Wave 00 commit.

Files changed:
- `README.md`
- `docs/product-brief.md`
- `docs/demo-story.md`
- `PLAN.md`
- `scripts/verify-scaffold.sh`
- `logs/execution-log.md`
- `logs/verification-log.md`

Reviewer files read and included:
- `logs/reviewer-inbox/wave-00-20260601-1131-review.md`
- `logs/reviewer-inbox/wave-00-20260601-1133-rereview.md`
- `logs/reviewer-inbox/wave-01-20260601-1132-review.md`
- `logs/reviewer-inbox/wave-01-20260601-1134-rereview.md`

Commands:
- `rg -n "certif|agent-ready|Splunk-ready|Platform" README.md docs`
- `bash scripts/verify-scaffold.sh`
- `find logs/reviewer-inbox -maxdepth 1 -type f | sort`
- `sed -n '1,260p' logs/reviewer-inbox/wave-00-20260601-1131-review.md`
- `sed -n '1,300p' logs/reviewer-inbox/wave-00-20260601-1133-rereview.md`
- `sed -n '1,300p' logs/reviewer-inbox/wave-01-20260601-1132-review.md`
- `sed -n '1,300p' logs/reviewer-inbox/wave-01-20260601-1134-rereview.md`
- `bash -n scripts/verify-scaffold.sh && bash scripts/verify-scaffold.sh`
- `rg -n "reviewer-notes|reviewer-inbox|project files" PLAN.md scripts/verify-scaffold.sh logs/execution-log.md logs/verification-log.md`

Result:
- PASS

Notes:
- `MEDIUM-001` fixed by updating `PLAN.md` to require unique reviewer files under `logs/reviewer-inbox/`.
- `LOW-001` fixed by changing the scaffold verifier to report project files excluding `.git`.
- Wave 01 reviewer `LOW-001` was resolved by the Wave 01 execution and verification log entries.
- Wave 00 rereview passed with no open findings.
- Wave 01 rereview `LOW-001` was resolved by separating reviewer files from executor-edited files in this log.
- Final verifier output after the reviewer response was `PASS: scaffold verified`, `waves: 42`, `project files: 88`.

## 2026-06-01 11:30 - Wave 00

Scope:
- Verified the repository control system before implementation begins.
- Confirmed root docs, wave files, reviewer inbox, risk register, and scaffold verifier are present.

Files changed:
- `logs/execution-log.md`
- `logs/verification-log.md`

Commands:
- `bash scripts/verify-scaffold.sh`
- `find . -maxdepth 3 -type f | sort`
- `find logs/reviewer-inbox -maxdepth 1 -type f | sort`
- `bash scripts/verify-scaffold.sh`

Result:
- PASS

Notes:
- No source implementation files were created or modified.
- Reviewer inbox contains only `logs/reviewer-inbox/README.md`.
- The final verifier rerun after log edits reported `PASS: scaffold verified`, `waves: 42`, `files: 101`; this was a raw workspace count that included `.git` before the verifier was corrected.

Result:
- PASS.
