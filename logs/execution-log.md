## 2026-06-01 11:38 - Wave 02

Scope:
- Chose the conservative TypeScript implementation stack.
- Added npm package manifest, lockfile, TypeScript config, and ignored generated files.
- Added README development commands.
- Fixed the scaffold verifier project-file count after dependency installation exposed `node_modules` noise.

Files changed:
- `.gitignore`
- `README.md`
- `docs/stack-decision.md`
- `package.json`
- `package-lock.json`
- `tsconfig.json`
- `scripts/verify-scaffold.sh`
- `logs/execution-log.md`
- `logs/verification-log.md`

Reviewer files read and included:
- `logs/reviewer-inbox/wave-01-20260601-1135-rereview.md`
- `logs/reviewer-inbox/wave-01-20260601-1136-rereview.md`
- `logs/reviewer-inbox/wave-02-20260601-1137-review.md`
- `logs/reviewer-inbox/wave-02-20260601-1138-rereview.md`
- `logs/reviewer-inbox/wave-02-20260601-1139-rereview.md`

Commands:
- `node --version && npm --version`
- `npm install`
- `sed -n '1,220p' docs/stack-decision.md`
- `npm test`
- `npm run check`
- `sed -n '1,320p' logs/reviewer-inbox/wave-02-20260601-1137-review.md`
- `sed -n '1,320p' logs/reviewer-inbox/wave-02-20260601-1138-rereview.md`
- `sed -n '1,320p' logs/reviewer-inbox/wave-02-20260601-1139-rereview.md`
- `find logs/reviewer-inbox -maxdepth 1 -type f | sort`

Result:
- PASS

Notes:
- Node version was `v22.21.0`; npm version was `10.9.4`.
- `npm install` added 54 packages, audited 55 packages, and reported 0 vulnerabilities.
- `npm test` passed with `--passWithNoTests`; no test files exist yet, which is acceptable only for stack selection.
- `npm run check` passed after the verifier was updated to exclude `.git`, `node_modules`, `dist`, and `coverage` from the informational project-file count.
- Wave 02 reviewer `LOW-001` was fixed by excluding generated dependency/build directories from the verifier file count.
- Wave 02 reviewer `LOW-002` was fixed by adding this execution entry and the matching verification entry.
- Wave 02 rereview saw `LOW-001` resolved and had a stale snapshot for `LOW-002`; this entry and the matching verification entry resolve it before commit.
- Wave 02 final rereview passed with no open findings.

## 2026-06-01 11:33 - Wave 01

Scope:
- Locked the implementation-facing product narrative.
- Added a root README entry point.
- Resolved reviewer Wave 00 control-system findings that arrived after the Wave 00 commit.

Files changed:

- `rg -n "reviewer-notes|reviewer-inbox|project files" PLAN.md scripts/verify-scaffold.sh logs/execution-log.md logs/verification-log.md`

Result:
- PASS

Notes:
- `MEDIUM-001` fixed by updating `PLAN.md` to require unique reviewer files under `logs/reviewer-inbox/`.
- `LOW-001` fixed by changing the scaffold verifier to report project files excluding `.git`.
- Wave 01 reviewer `LOW-001` was resolved by the Wave 01 execution and verification log entries.
- Wave 00 rereview passed with no open findings.
- Wave 01 rereview `LOW-001` was resolved by separating reviewer files from executor-edited files in this log.
- Final verifier output after the reviewer response was `PASS: scaffold verified`, `waves: 42`, `project files: 88`.

## 2026-06-01 11:30 - Wave 00

Scope:
- Verified the repository control system before implementation begins.
- Confirmed root docs, wave files, reviewer inbox, risk register, and scaffold verifier are present.

- `logs/execution-log.md`
- `logs/verification-log.md`

Commands:
- `bash scripts/verify-scaffold.sh`

- `find logs/reviewer-inbox -maxdepth 1 -type f | sort`
- `bash scripts/verify-scaffold.sh`

Result:
- PASS

Notes:
- No source implementation files were created or modified.
- Reviewer inbox contains only `logs/reviewer-inbox/README.md`.
- The final verifier rerun after log edits reported `PASS: scaffold verified`, `waves: 42`, `files: 101`; this was a raw workspace count that included `.git` before the verifier was corrected.
